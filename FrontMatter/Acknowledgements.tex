% There was a common joke told at school, around 10 years ago, whenever a friend would receive an award of some kind. The person (or, rather, the squeaky 12-year-old child) would imitate reading an extensive list of those whom they would like to thank: their mom, their dad, their distant cousin, their dog, their neighbour's cat, their goldfish---and so on until laughter inevitably erupted. At the time, it was likely humorous because of the sheer extent of the gratitude---down to every last character in the bigger story. "Even your goldfish!? (\emph{raucous giggling ensues})"

% However, in hindsight, I suspect that such a response is, in fact, appropriate. For when I consider the achievement of finishing a degree---of achieving any milestone---how can I begin to delineate between those who were a part of the journey, and those who were not? Instead, it seems that each person I have ever interacted with, across a broad range of domains, in a spectrum of good and bad experiences, has brought me to this exact point. Yes, even the (metaphorical) goldfish.

% To all of you, then, thank you.

% Nonetheless, some special mentions are in order---for those who have played an extraordinary role in the process, and who have done so with patience, kindness, and grace.
