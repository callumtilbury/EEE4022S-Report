\chapter*{Abstract}

\gls{pr} is a variant of radar technology in which no dedicated transmitter is used for operation. Instead, \gls{pr} systems use so-called \gls{ioo}---such as existing radio-station broadcasts---for the detection of objects in a scene. In the past decade, there has been an increased interest in the use of \emph{digital} broadcasting signals as \gls{ioo}s, as these signals offer a variety of benefits to a \gls{pr} system. One of the digital broadcasting standards that has garnered attention for use in \gls{pr} is the \gls{dab} format, which is slowly being adopted around the world to replace the antiquated analogue modes of audio broadcasting.

The aim of this project was to research, design, and implement a \gls{dab} processing chain for the context of a \gls{pr} system. Though prior work has been done on \gls{dab}-based \gls{pr} implementations, there are seemingly no comprehensive descriptions of the salient functions required for the \gls{dab} chain in \gls{pr} systems. Moreover, the literature considering solely \gls{dab} signals focuses too much on the intricacies of the \gls{dab} standard, in a way that is unnecessarily complex for \gls{pr} applications. Therefore, there is a need for a clear and thorough exposition of the design procedure for the \gls{pr}-focused \gls{dab} processing chain.

It begins with a brief surveillance of the available literature, followed by a comprehensive consideration of the relevant aspects of the \gls{dab} standard, including the theoretical concepts that underpin it. Following this is a detailed unpacking of the various components of the \gls{dab} chain, starting from a high-level overview, and then zooming into the functionality of each sub-block in the broader system.

The \gls{dab} chain is then validated via several testing procedures, and is shown to pass all of them. It is thus concluded that the designed processing chain indeed works.
