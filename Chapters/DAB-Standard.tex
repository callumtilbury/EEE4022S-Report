\section{Overview}
This chapter aims to outline the key components of the \gls{dab} standard, as prescribed by the \gls{etsi} in~\cite{dabstandard}. It begins with a discussion on \gls{cofdm} and \gls{dqpsk}, each of which is fundamental to \gls{dab}. Thereafter, the structure of a \gls{dab} frame will be mentioned, with special highlights made to the null and phase-reference symbols. Note, however, that since this report focuses on \gls{dab} signals within the context of \gls{pr}, it is unnecessary for a complete and thorough description of the \gls{dab} format---in fact, many simplifications can be made. For example, the \gls{dab}-based \gls{pr} chain need not dive into the specifics of the source audio coding, and so on.

\section{Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing}
In 1966, Robert W. Chang published an incredibly important paper~\cite{Chang1966}, outlining the idea of \gls{ofdm}.

\subsection{Motivation}

The \gls{dab} standard is specifically targeted at the context of mobile reception in urban environments. Each of these characteristics presents notable challenges, and thus required clever design. "Mobile reception" is because most radio listening occurs in moving vehicles, while people are commuting; "urban environments" is because many of these listeners will reside in or near city centres.

Consider a scenario where one is wanting to transmit a set of symbols, \(\mathcal{D}\), using a \gls{psk} modulation scheme\footnote{A detailed description of \gls{psk} modulation is given in section~\ref{sect:dab-std_psk}}, where the phase of a carrier wave is successively modulated by each symbol in \(\mathcal{D}\) for a period of \(t_s\). This modulated wave travels through an urban environment with many high-rise buildings and even a mountain, from a "Transmitter" to a "Receiver", where the former is a stationary antenna, but the latter is a moving mobile device---a car radio, for example.

Provided there is a direct path from the transmitter to the receiver, the signal---the "direct signal"---will travel along this path. However, due to the surrounding clutter, there will be additional versions of the signal---"delayed signals." This effect is called \emph{Multipath}.

Figure~\ref{fig:multipath-illustration} illustrates this scenario with dashed lines indicating the various signal paths.

    \caption{Illustration of an environment where multipath occurs}
    \label{fig:multipath-illustration}
\end{figure}

Logically, the direct signal will be the shortest path from the transmitter to the receiver, and thus the time to receive this signal will be shorter than for all the others---it will "arrive" first. A particular delayed signal will be received after an amount of time, call it \(t_d\), depending on the clutter contained within the scene. Of course, the receiver will not be able simply to separate the direct- and delayed signals---it will instead record a superposition of these signals, as a single 'received signal'.

There are, in essence, two scenarios that can result from this superposition effect. Firstly, the delay period could be shorter than the symbol period, \(t_d < t_s\), as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:multipath-symbol-lessthan}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

Notice how the delayed signal has 

Alternatively, the delay period could be longer than the symbol period, \(t_d > t_s\), as shown in figure~\ref{fig:multipath-symbol-morethan}.

\end{figure}


Suppose one wanted to transmit . There are, in essence, two broad approaches to this aim. The first, which is markedly simpler, is a serial approach: simply to modulate the phase of a single carrier wave with successive elements of \(\mathcal{D}\). Alternatively, one could take a parallel approach. That is, to split \(\mathcal{D}\) into \(n\) subsets, and then use these subsets to modulate \(n\) independent carriers respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:carrier-illustration} illustrates these situations with two simplified spectrograms---for the sake of clarity, the frequency components are shown to be perfectly impulsive. Here, each carrier wave's phase is modulated with one of four values, \(\big\{\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{3\pi}{4}, \frac{5\pi}{4}, \frac{7\pi}{4}\big\}\), in fixed time intervals.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:serial-carrier} shows the serial case, where all 9 symbols are successively modulated on the carrier wave with a frequency of \(\omega_0\). Figure~\ref{fig:parallel-carrier}, on the other hand, shows the parallel case, with the 9 symbols split into 3 separate groups, respectively modulating carriers with frequencies of \((\omega_0 - \Delta \omega)\), \(\omega_0\), and \((\omega_0 + \Delta \omega)\). Notice the symbol period for the latter situation is 3 times longer than that of the former. This shows that in each scenario, the same amount of data is transmitted over the same amount of time.

While the serial scheme is simpler, the parallel scheme has two important advantages.

Multipath, inter-symbol interference

Frequency selective fading

\subsection{Frequency Division Multiplexing}
The illustration from figure~\ref{fig:carrier-illustration} was an example of \gls{fdm}, where the frequency domain is divided---i.e. multiplexed---into separate regions, each carrying independent information. There is one caveat with the previous example, however. The frequency components, as shown, were assumed to be impulsive. This implies that adjacent carriers could be infinitely close to each other without any crosstalk---that is, interference between the carriers. Unfortunately, this cannot be the case.

To understand why, consider a carrier wave, \(f(t)\), which has a frequency of \(\omega_0\), and is recorded over a period of \(T\) seconds. Notice that this is equivalent to multiplying \(f(t)\) by a windowing function, \(w(t)\), with a width of \(T\). Figure~\ref{fig:sampling-sine} depicts this, where a simple rectangular pulse is used as the windowing function. Note, however, that more complex windowing functions can be used, and the point will remain. The resulting windowed carrier wave is notated as \(f_T(t)\).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sampling-sine.pdf}
    \caption{Depiction of sampling as a multiplication with a finite window function}
    \label{fig:sampling-sine}
\end{figure}

Consider now the impact of windowing as viewed in the frequency domain. The original carrier wave, \(f(t)\), which theoretically spans over all time, is perfectly impulsive. However, multiplication with the windowing function in time is equivalent to convolution with the window's spectrum in frequency. The exact details of this spectrum depend on the windowing function used, but for a simple rectangular function,
\begin{equation}
    w(t) = \textrm{rect}\Big(\frac{t}{T}\Big) \xLeftrightarrow{\quad\mathcal{F}\quad} W(\omega) = \text{Sa}()
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sampling-sine-freq.pdf}
    \caption{Effect of windowing on spectrum}
    \label{fig:sampling-sine-freq}
\end{figure}

Instead, each carrier has an associated spectrum, and this spectrum influences the ability for one to demodulate the other carriers.

How, then, does that influence the ability to perform \gls{fdm}?

Suppose one has three carriers, each with a \(\textrm{Sa}(\omega) = \frac{\sin \omega}{\omega}\) spectrum. If the centre frequencies of these carriers are sufficiently distant from the others, there will be negligible interference from one spectrum's sidelobes to another spectrum's mainlobe. This is seen in figure~\ref{fig:three-sincs-good-distance}.
